app/routers/forecasts.py — AgriGuard Price Forecasting Router
=============================================================
FastAPI router exposing agricultural price forecasting endpoints.

Forecast pipeline:
  1. Load and clean WFP Uganda price CSV, blended with the fresher-cadence
     FEWS NET (FDW) feed where the two overlap  (load_price_data)
  2. Filter to the requested commodity × market combination
   3. Run the shared rolling-origin validated ensemble from ml/pipeline.py
      (robust level, damped trend, and monthly seasonal candidates)
   4. Calibrate intervals from walk-forward residuals via quant_bridge
  5. Return structured ForecastResponse with trend label and alert

Endpoints:
  GET /forecasts/commodities             → list available commodities & markets
  GET /forecasts/{commodity}             → single-market forecast
  GET /forecasts/compare/{commodity}     → multi-market comparison

Design notes:
  - Prophet is an optional last-resort dependency; the shared pipeline does
    not require it and is the production default.
  - All price values are rounded to 2 decimal places before returning.
  - Confidence is derived from the relative width of the prediction interval
    and clamped to [0.0, 1.0] so clients never receive nonsense values.
  - The alert threshold (5 %) is intentionally conservative for MVP.

Changes from v1:
  - Extracted _filter_subset() helper — removes duplication between
    get_forecast() and compare_markets()
  - Added _clamp_confidence() — v1 could return negative confidence values
  - Added XGBoost residual correction layer (xgb_residual_correction)
  - Added /forecasts/history/{commodity} endpoint for sparkline data
  - Added market fallback chain in get_forecast (market → region → national)
  - Replaced bare except with explicit exception types throughout
  - DataPath is now resolved via settings.data_path (not __file__ hacks)
  - get_trend_label() now uses a longer window and a smoother threshold
  - compare_markets() returns partial results + a "skipped" list in metadata
  - Added structured logging with commodity / market / horizon context
